Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

Find `BUILD.bat` here in the root folder of tgstation, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile.

After it finishes, you can then [setup the server](.github/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.
